        <h2 id="C1">Introduction</h2>
        <p><i>A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.</i>[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the <span style="font-size: 20px;" class="gradient-text">Milky Way</span> galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a thousand stars,[4] to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.</p>
        <h2 id="C2">Continuation</h2>
        <p style="color:aqua";>Galaxies are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral, or irregular.[6] The Milky Way is an example of a spiral galaxy. It is estimated that there are between 200 billion[7] (2×1011) to 2 trillion[8] galaxies in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances in the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly)[9][a] and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy, its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)[12]</p>
